# the key scientific question (KSQ)
Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?
- Trastuzumab: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.
- Bevacizumab: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.

# what is meant by antibody therapies and how it works?
Antibody therapies are mainly used in targeting unwanted cells in this context it's used to target cancer cell by binding to specific markers on cancer cells or tissue 

# how does Trastuzumab work:
Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) meaning that it targets cancer cells that express HER2 protein.
it acts by binding to the extracellular domain of HER2 and inhibits its homodimerization, preventing HER2-mediated signaling, It is also thought to facilitate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, leading to the death of cells that express HER2

# how does Bevacizumab work:
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) meaning that it targets cancer cells that express VEGF protein.
VEGF helps cancer to grow blood vessels, so Bevacizumab acts by inhibiting tumor growth through multiple mechanisms including preventing the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis inhibition), inducing regression of newly formed vasculature and normalization of abnormal tumor blood vessels to improve cytotoxic agents’ delivery

# Why do we use scRNA data 
scRNA technology allows  us to look at the gene expression of each cell type in any heterogenous population of cells, so identifying cells and understanding their expression profile would help us see what genes specify each group of cells and target these genes, in this context identifying cancer cell subtypes and analysis of its gene expression patterns would help us to see what other cancer cells that express HER2 and VEGF proteins to target them by therapies like Bevacizumab and Trastuzumab
