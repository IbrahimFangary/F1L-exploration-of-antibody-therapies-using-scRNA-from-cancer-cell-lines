# F1L Exploration of Antibody Therapies Using scRNA-seq from Cancer Cell Lines

Analysis of scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines to explore the use of antibody therapies, such as Trastuzumab<!-- and Bevacizumab -->, in additional cancers.

This repository contains:
- A `notebooks` directory with all Jupyter notebooks used for this analysis.
- A `MEMO & Key Points.md` file summarizing key points from the [Kinker et al. paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135089/).
